# GPN Tron Racer 🕹️

[gpn-tron](https://github.com/freehuntx/gpn-tron) by [freehuntx](https://github.com/freehuntx) was a coding challenge at [GPN21](https://entropia.de/GPN21). Attendants coded bots to compete in a classic game of [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game)) which was broadcasted on a wall of screens at the event.

This was my (mostly successful) attempt to dominate the leaderboards at the cost of some (all) sleep.
The voronoi branch contains the unfinished attempt to improve it even further. The idea was to calculate a voronoi partition with each of the players as seeds. The bot would then try to maximize the difference between it's own area and the competing bot's areas with every turn.

Unfortunately, time was not on my side and I wasn't able to finish the bot. Maybe next year! 😊
